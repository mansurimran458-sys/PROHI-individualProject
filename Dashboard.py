    ## Aims

    After completing the course the student should be able to:
    - explain basic project management methods
    - be able to account for success factors in Health Informatics projects
    - understand basic methods and tools in the field of data science and machine learning
    - explain process models for data mining projects
    - explain the difference between rule-based methods and machine learning methods
    - apply basic project management methods
    - work in an international multidisciplinary project group
    - independently lead and implement a limited project in health informatics - document the steps in the design of a prototype for a health informatics project
    - apply the steps in a process model for data mining projects
    - apply methods from the field of text mining on different types of health informatics problems
    - explain and argue for their positions regarding the implementation of a health informatics project
    - explain how to work with sensitive health information in a safe and ethical way.

"""
The final project aims to apply data science concepts and skills on a 
medical case study that you and your team select from a public data source.
The project assumes that you bring the technical Python skills from 
previous courses (*DSHI*: Data Science for Health Informatics), as well as 
the analytical skills to argue how and why specific techniques could
enhance the problem domain related to the selected dataset.

### Project summary

This two-page Streamlit dashboard demonstrates a clean, minimal structure for a stroke-focused data app without loading real files. The Dashboard presents three input widgets derived from the dataset schemaâ€”gender, age, and work typeâ€”alongside a synthetic data table and a simple chart to illustrate layout and components. The design emphasizes readability, discoverability, and reproducibility over functionality, making it suitable for coursework demonstrations. Potential extensions include robust data ingestion, validation, exploratory data analysis, and a properly evaluated classification pipeline with calibration and fairness checks. This foundation supports iterative development of clinical analytics while keeping the initial scope simple and transparent for demonstration and review.
